hello-world
===========

My first GitHub project.

I am a computer game programmer by trade; interested in politics, economics, data analysis, football (real football, with feet), motor racing, cars, 90's eurodance and cheese; I hope to learn more in my field and progress my career, and perhaps learn enough to write a book.
